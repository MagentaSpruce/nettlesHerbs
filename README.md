Client product - Fully responsive and custom business site built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NodeJS, Express &amp; MongoDB

This client product utilizes a custom built API for processing emails and payments. This website was built for an Herbal Medicine company based out of Jacksonville, FL. 

Building this project out has helped me to better learn and practice the following:
1) Project preparation and planning
2) Flexbox & CSS Grid
3) Media queries
4) DRY principles



This is a large and dynamic application. The API documentation can be found here:(). A very general, non-refactored overview of the project with pertinent notes and inputs is below. To view the refactored final product please check the relevant code files.
