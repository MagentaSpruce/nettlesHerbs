# nettlesHerbs

Business site - Fully responsive and custom web application built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NodeJS, Express, MongoDB & PUG.

This site product utilizes a custom built API with over 30 endpoints and is also able to handle the processing of emails and payments. This website was built for an Herbal Medicine company based out of Jacksonville, FL. The site is fully functional but not yet live as it is still awaiting final content before being finished and deployed to a domain.

The current app can be visited here: https://nettles-herbs.herokuapp.com/home

This is a large and dynamic application. The API documentation can be found here: https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/15470113/TzeUnUBB 

There is no walkthrough for this project as it is much too large. I have a notebook with meticulous notes detailing the complete project construction for anyone that may be interested however.
