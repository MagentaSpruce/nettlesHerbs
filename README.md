Client product - Fully responsive and custom business site built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NodeJS, Express &amp; MongoDB

This client product utilizes a custom built API for processing emails and payments. This website was built for an Herbal Medicine company based out of Jacksonville, FL.

Building this project out has helped me to better learn and practice the following:

1. Project preparation and planning
2. Flexbox & CSS Grid
3. Media queries
4. ES Lint
5. NodeJS
6. Creating schema and models
7. Routing
8. CRUD operations
9. Working with remote databases
10. Express
11. Mongoose/MongoDB
12. npm packages
13. Regular expressions
14. Error handling
15. Authenitcation
16. Jason Web Tokens
17. Authorization and security

This is a large and dynamic application. The API documentation can be found here:(). A very general, non-refactored overview of the project with pertinent notes and inputs is below. To view the refactored final product please check the relevant code files.
